Oh. Hi! I guess...
You've seen my so called old profile introduction before, I think it's bad since most of it are outdated so, here's a new one!

# Introduction
Hi! I'm Pixie, known as `Pixie67#3089` on discord. You've probably founded me through github search page or on my discord profile, so if you're reading this, welcome! Here's some things you need to know me :

- I'm currently 15 (Soon to be 16)
- Birthdate is 10/8/2007
- Malaysian, though I can speak english more than "Bahasa Melayu"

As you can see it is only few, but that's all you need to know really.

# Interests

## Discord bots in general

In my last old profile introduction, I said before that I am currently making my bot written entirely on `Discord.py`, while it is indeed true in the past, I eventually dropped it months after making that profile introduction. The reason is that back then, the maintainer of Discrd.py dropped the project due to the enforce of slash commands api. Though some time later, he does pick back up the project again and to this day hes still maintain the project so huge thanks for him to revive back the project!

Well in that timeframe, I found an discord api wrapper that I'm interested about, `Discord.js`. Back then I was a fucking dumbass that get spoonfed by Youtubers that do code bots (what this means that I copy pasted the code from other guys without understanding the code first, basically fuck around and find out!), I decided to give discord.js a try.

I failed...

Well, the main reason which is the biggest reason it failed is I have little to no knowlegde of Javascript and its basics, which is a big no-no when it comes to coding (Y'know, *Learn Javascript first before doing anything*), so I eventually gave up.

Fast forward to 2023, I just got my laptop fixed (which is the network driver that have been bugging me out since the start of 2023), and I was bored on what to do. Then it sparked me, the situation about discord.js and me, the spoonfeed situation and fuckloads of things. I thought it would be funny if I "Return to coding and properly learn things than I did years ago.". So I did.

I learn javascript, a *bit* of html, and even discord.js too! (Huge props to CodeCademy for the courses, I love them!)

And uhh here we are, currently doing my first **proper** discord.js bot. Shoutouts to my brain for the thoughts :thumbs_up:


# **Ex**troduction

Well, that's all I could talk about on this file, maybe I should come back and add more things on the **interests** section. Maybe games? Ultrakill? Or maybe the time I got my account hacked? Who knows. Oh well, time would tell.

Alright, I see you in the flipside and as always,

**May your Points on Stackoverflow be many, and your mistakes-on-your-coding-because-your-got-a-syntax-error few**
